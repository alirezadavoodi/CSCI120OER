#problem1

#Write a python program which asks the user to enter a number which represents the value of a circleâ€™s 
#radius and calculates and prints the area and perimeter of the circle.

print("Problem1--------------------------------------------")
radius = float(input("Please enter the radius of the circle: "))

PI = 3.14

area = (radius**2)*PI
perimeter = 2*radius*PI

print(area)
print(perimeter)

print("For circle with radius %.2f , the area is %.2f and the perimeter is %.2f" %(radius, area, perimeter))


#problem2
#-	Write a program which asks the user who is a student about the following information:
#o	firstName
#o	lastName
#o	age
#o	name of the college
#o	studentID
#o	Number of courses the student has taken so far
#o	Admission year to the college
#-	And print an enrollment letter for the student with this format:

#********************************************* 
#program2
#Enrollment Letter for [first name] [last name]
#This is to certify that [first name] [last name], age: [age] years old, has been attending the [college name] college 
#since [Admission year to the college] and taken [Number of courses] courses since then.

#Thanks,
#College Manager

#program3
#-	Write a python program which calculates the following mathematical function and prints the result:
#	F(x,y) = x^2 + sqrt(xy) - xlogxy / x+y

#program4
#-	Write a python which asks the user to enter 4 words and calculates the total length of the words 
#that have been entered as well as the max and min length of the words have been entered.

#program5
#-	Write a program that takes two input from the user and then exchange their values. 
#For instance if the user 5 for number1 and 10 for number2, 
#then the program exchange their values and number1 will become 10 and the number2 will become 5.
