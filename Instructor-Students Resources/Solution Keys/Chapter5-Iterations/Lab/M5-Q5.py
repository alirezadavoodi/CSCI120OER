#Problem5

#-	The program receives a statement which contains only alphabet variables and binary operations including +, -, *, / and % and check whether the statement is a valid arithmetic statement or not. 

#•	The statement might contain parenthesis as well. For instance:
#•	a+b*a+c/c%y
#•	(a+b)*(a/d-(a/b))

#•	You can make this assumption that the variable names contain only one alphabet (like a, b, c) and cannot have more than one alphabets (like ab, temp, sum, …)
#•	Remember from the lecture that 2 conditions should be satisfied in order an arithmetic operation is considered valid. Search in your lecture notes for it if you don’t remember it.
