**Description:**

The main objective of the project is to create an OER package for CSCI120 course in Columbia College.

**Deliverables:**

- Designing course modules and outline
- Creating lecture notes
- Lecture notes final review and modification
- Creating sample questions + video recording
- Creating the course website (Github) and making the course available on different platform
- Reviewing/editing the Chapters (if needed)
- Testing the source codes used in the textbook
- Final reporting


**OER Package:**

- **For Students:**
  - Lecture Note (Non-editable)
  - Sample Questions/Answers
  - Sample Midterm + Answers
  - Sample Final exam + Answers

- **For Instructors:**
  - Course timeline
  - Lecture Note (Editable)
  - Labs
  - Assignments + Source Code
  - Sample Quizzes 
  - Sample Midterm Exam
  - Sample Final Exam
  - Sample Project + Project Starter + Implementation (Source Code)

**Definition**

- **Lecture Note:** Is PowerPoint files prepared for the instructors and students to review the topic of the chapter
- **Assignments:** Is set of questions assigned to students to do as homework. It is can be done individually or in group. Assignments usually contain 5-10 questions.
- **Labs:** The labs are designed for students to practice the last lecture topics (Designed for 1-2 hours)- Labs are usually 3-5 questions.
- **Sample Practices:** Sample is extra/complementary examples for students to learn more.
- **Quiz:** Quiz is mainly multiple-choice questions to practice the subject.
- **Exam:** Exam is questions for the midterm and final exam.
- **Project:** The project is defined for the course.
- **Source Code:** Source code is code for the assignments, labs, tutorials, and sample practices.
